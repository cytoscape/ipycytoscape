    "### Recap.   \n",
    "We had started in he first part of this ipycytoscape series with the basics of graphs. In order to get into graphs I made the point that it is better starting by visualizing because an image is worth a million words and also a million ecuations.\n",
    "We built a small graph in the first part and we made bit a bit some modifications to the graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For whom is this article? What do you need to know?\n",
    "You code in python but somehow you had never had anything to do with graphs.\n",
    "You read the first part of this series.\n",
    "You are familiar with dictionaries and JSON structures.\n",
    "You have some knowledge of pandas. (If you dont have, you might skip the last part).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our project\n",
    "You have to imagine that you are a coder that is ultemately in charge of creating a GUI that shows a rail net in an interactive way showing diffierent kinds of information for the operators to be able to take decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a coder after having read the first article you are at a point where you might be facing the following situations:\n",
    "- A friend told you that visualizing graphs in notebooks is not the way to go: I assure you that you will be able to tell him \"voila\". (\"here you are\" in French)\n",
    "- Another friend might have told you that in order to really work in python with graphs you better start digging into Networkx. Well you might tell him that a pic is worth a thousand words, and for what it takes, a pic is worth a thousand equations. You will be able to jump from visualizing with ipycytoscape to Networkx, better than the other way around, and that is my whole point here.\n",
    "- And yet other friend of you told you that in any case jupyter is not for a production environement, and then you might mention Jupyter Hub and see his reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding data structures another very common situation:\n",
    "- The same friend tells you that it is difficult to find use for the whole exercise because he has to work with excel sheets data and google sheets and csvs. Well remember you can read excel sheets data into Pandas. And I will make the point in this article  how important is to be able to use pandas dataframes (and hence any tabular data, CSV, etc) as imput for graphs. Whatever the popularity of python, excel is by far the most used database and tabular data structure in the galaxy, like it or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said lets see where we stand and move fordward.   \n",
    "We have built a 'mini' German rail net with rail connections between 6 cities. BER (Berlin), MUN(Munich), HAM (Hamburg), FRA (Frankfurt) and LEP(LEIPZIG). That resulted in a graph.\n",
    "We added also some information to the graphs.\n",
    "Note: I will tend to paste here all the code neccesary in order to avoid you to have to pick it up in github or whereever else, the code are snippets of gitgist."

    "This jupyter is the continuation of part one:\n",
    "Ipycytoscape from Scratch.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this article is to learn graphs from scratch using ipycytoscape. In order to get into graphs I had made the point that it is better starting by visualizing because an image is worth a million words and also a million equations.\n",
    "A small graph was built in the first part, and we made little by little  some modifications to the graph showing how modify the graph using ipycytoscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For whom is this article/notebook? What do you need to know?\n",
    "You code in python but somehow you had never had anything to do with graphs.\n",
    "You have read the first part notebook.\n",
    "You are familiar with dictionaries and JSON structures.\n",
    "You have some knowledge of pandas. (If you don't have, you might skip the last part).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our project\n",
    "You have to imagine that you are a coder that is ultimately in charge of creating a GUI that shows the German rail net in an interactive way showing different kinds of information for the operators to be able to take decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some notes:\n",
    "As a coder after having read the first article you are at a point where you might be facing the following situations:\n",
    "- A friend told you that visualizing graphs in notebooks is not the way to go: I assure you that you will be able to tell him \"voilà\". (\"here you are\" in French)\n",
    "- Another friend might have told you that in order to really work in python with graphs you better start digging into Networkx. Well you might tell him that a pic is worth a thousand words, and for what it takes, a pic is worth a thousand equations. You will be able to jump from visualizing with ipycytoscape to Networkx, better than the other way around, that is my point here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### That said lets see where we stand and move forward.   \n",
    "We have built a 'mini' German rail net with rail connections between 6 cities. BER (Berlin), MUN(Munich), HAM (Hamburg), FRA (Frankfurt) and LEP(LEIPZIG). That resulted in a graph.\n",
    "We added also some information to the graphs.\n",
    "Note: I will tend to paste here all the code AND DATA necessary in order to avoid you to have to pick it up in GitHub or read it from disc.\n",
    "\n",
    "What comes next is the situation we had in part one.\n",

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Quantstack/ipycytoscape.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Quantstack/ipycytoscape) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ipycytoscape/badge/?version=latest)](https://ipycytoscape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/QuantStack/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/QuantStack/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

A widget enabling interactive graph visualization with [cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) in JupyterLab and the Jupyter notebook.

Try it out using binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/QuantStack/ipycytoscape/stable?filepath=examples) or install and try out the [examples](examples).

#### Supports:

* Conversion from NetworkX see [example1](https://github.com/QuantStack/ipycytoscape/blob/master/examples/Test%20NetworkX%20methods.ipynb), [example2](https://github.com/QuantStack/ipycytoscape/blob/master/examples/NetworkX%20Example.ipynb)
* Conversion from Pandas DataFrame see [example](https://github.com/QuantStack/ipycytoscape/blob/master/examples/DataFrame%20interaction.ipynb)

## Installation

With `mamba`:

```
mamba install -c conda-forge ipycytoscape
```

With `conda`:

```
conda install -c conda-forge ipycytoscape
```

With `pip`:

```bash
pip install ipycytoscape
```

#### For jupyterlab users:

There is an aditional step if you're using JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager jupyter-cytoscape
```

And make sure you have an updated version of `nodejs` (>13) and Jupyter Lab in your environment.

If you are using Jupyter Notebook 5.2 or earlier, you may also need to enable
the nbextension:
```bash
jupyter nbextension enable --py [--sys-prefix|--user|--system] ipycytoscape
```

## For a development installation:
**(requires npm)**

While not required, we recommend creating a conda environment to work in:
```bash
conda create -n ipycytoscape -c conda-forge jupyterlab nodejs>13 networkx
conda activate ipycytoscape

# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/QuantStack/ipycytoscape.git
cd ipycytoscape

# Install python package for development, runs npm install and npm run build
pip install -e .
```

When developing ipycytoscape, you need to manually enable the extension with the
notebook / lab frontend. For lab, this is done by the command:

```
# install jupyterlab-manager and this extension
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager --no-build
jupyter labextension install .
```

For classic notebook, you can run:

```
jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --overwrite --py ipycytoscape
jupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix --py ipycytoscape
```

Note that the `--symlink` flag doesn't work on Windows, so you will here have to run
the `install` command every time that you rebuild your extension. For certain installations
you might also need another flag instead of `--sys-prefix`, but we won't cover the meaning
of those flags here.

### How to see your changes

#### Typescript: 
To continuously monitor the project for changes and automatically trigger a rebuild, start Jupyter in watch mode:
```bash
jupyter lab --watch
```
And in a separate session, begin watching the source directory for changes:
```bash
npm run watch
```

#### Python:
If you make a change to the python code then you need to restart the notebook kernel to have it take effect.

### How to run tests locally

Install necessary dependencies with pip:

```
pip install -e .[test]
```

Or with mamba:

```
mamba -c conda-forge install networkx pandas matplotlib nbval pytest
```

Or with conda:

```
conda -c conda-forge install networkx pandas matplotlib nbval pytest
```

#### And to run it:

```
pytest
```

### How to build the docs

Install the following dependencies:

`conda install -c conda-forge sphinx sphinx-copybutton jupyter_sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme nbsphinx`

and

`pip install nbsphinx_link`

Go to the docs directory:

`cd docs`

And build them: 

`make html`
